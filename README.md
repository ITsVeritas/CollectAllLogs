# CollectAllLogs
CollectAllLogs is designed to be used with the Run Scripts feature of MECM (SCCM). It will collect many logs from a device or collection of devices, upload them to
a management point, and send a status message which causes the primary to copy the zip from the management point to a directory of choice.
